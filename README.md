## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
E-Waste Facility Locator with Educational Content and Reward System

## Proposed Solution :
The solution will consist of a web application with a front-end and back-end component:

### Front-End:
User Interface for location search and device model input.
Interactive pop-ups displaying educational content on e-waste dangers.
Point system display and options for reward redemption.
### Back-End:
Database to store user location data (anonymized) and device model information.
### API integration:
Geolocation API integration to identify nearest e-waste facilities.
API integration (optional) with electronics manufacturers for device data (estimated recoverable precious metals).
Point system logic based on device type or estimated recoverable materials.


## Use Cases
### User Locates E-Waste Facility:
 User enters zip code or enables location services. The system pinpoints the nearest certified e-waste collection facility on a map with directions.
### Educational Pop-Ups: 
As users navigate the website, pop-ups appear explaining the harmful components in e-waste and their environmental/health impacts.
### Reward System (Optional): 
User enters their device model. The system estimates recoverable precious metals and awards points. Points can be redeemed for discounts, donations, or raffle entries.


## Technology Stack
### Front-End:
 HTML, CSS, Javascript (ReactJS or similar framework for interactivity).
### Back-End:
 Python (Django or Flask) for server-side logic and API integration.
### Database: 
PostgreSQL or MySQL for storing user data and facility locations.
### Geolocation API:
 Integration with Google Maps API or similar service.
### Optional API Integration:
 Manufacturer APIs for device data (if a more precise reward system is desired).


## Dependencies
Reliable web hosting service.
User agreement and privacy policy outlining data collection practices.
Partnerships with e-waste collection facilities for data verification and potential future integration for real-time availability updates.
